Plugins registry for Blosc users
================================

Blosc has a tradition of supporting different filters and codecs for compressing data,
and it was up to the user to choose one or another depending on his needs.
However, it is clear that there will always be scenarios where a richer variety
of them could be useful.  So the Blosc team has set new goals:

1) Implement a way for users to locally register filters and codecs so that they can use
   them in their setup at will.

2) Set up a central registry so that *other* users can make use of these filters and codecs
   without interfering with other ones that have been created by other users.

As a bonus, those codecs and filters accepted in the central registry and meeting the quality standards
defined in these guidelines will be distributed *inside* the C-Blosc2 library,
allowing a much easier way for others to use them: install C-Blosc2 library and you are all set.
Of course, to achieve such a status, plugins will require a careful testing process described below.


Plugin types
--------------

The plugins that are registered in the repository can be codecs or filters.

A **codec** is a program able to compress and decompress a digital data stream
with the objective of reduce dataset size to enable a faster transmission
of data.
Some codecs used by Blosc are e.g. *BLOSCLZ*, *LZ4* and *ZSTANDARD*.

A **filter** is a program that reorders the data without
changing its size, so that the initial and final size are equal.
A filter consists of encoder and decoder. Filter encoder is applied before
using the codec compressor (or codec encoder) in order to make data easier to compress
and filter decoder is used after codec decompressor (or codec decoder) to recover
the original data arrangement. 
Some filters actually used by Blosc are e.g. *SHUFFLE*, which rearranges data 
based on the typesize, or *TRUNC*, which zeroes mantissa bits to reduce
the precision of (floating point) data, and hence, increase the compression ratio.

Here it is an example on how the compression process goes:


    --------------------   filter encoder  -------------------   codec encoder   -------
    |        src        |   ----------->  |        tmp        |   ---------->   | c_src |
    --------------------                   -------------------                   -------

And the decompression process: 

    --------   codec decoder    -------------------   filter decoder  -------------------
    | c_src |    ----------->  |        tmp        |   ---------->   |        src        |
    --------                    -------------------                   -------------------

Moreover, during the pipeline process you can use even 6 different 
filters ordered as you prefer.


Blosc global registered plugins vs user registered plugins
----------------------------------------------------------

**Blosc global registered plugins** are official Blosc plugins that have passed through a selection process
and have been recognised by the Blosc Development Team. These plugins are available for 
everybody in the C-Blosc2 GitHub repository and users can install them anytime.

**User registered plugins** are plugins that users register locally, and they can use them
in the same way as in the examples `urcodecs.c` and `urfilters.c`.

If you only want to use a plugin on your own devices you can just register it as a user registered 
plugin with an ID between *BLOSC2_USER_REGISTERED_FILTERS_START* and *BLOSC2_USER_REGISTERED_FILTERS_STOP*. 
Otherwise, if you think that your plugin could be useful for the community you can apply for 
registering it as an official Blosc plugin following the next steps.


Requirements for registering plugins
------------------------------------

For users wanting to register a new codec or filter, there are some requirements
that their code must satisfy:

- First, the plugin code must be **developed in C**, have a relatively small footprint
  and meet decent quality code standards.

- Second, users must develop a test suite which prove that the plugin works correctly.

Finally, even if these requirements are completely satisfied, it is not
guaranteed that the plugin will be useful or contribute something
different from the existing ones, so the Blosc development team has the final
say and will decide if a plugin is to be accepted or not.


Steps
-----

1. First, tests must be provided and be passing.

   **It is completely mandatory and necessary to add these lines to `main()` in each test to make plugins machinery work:**
   - `blosc2_init()` at the beginning
   - `blosc2_destroy()` in the end

2. Then, the user must make a fork of the C-Blosc2 GitHub repository,
   adding a new folder within the plugin sources to the path `plugins/codecs` or
   `plugins/filters` depending on the plugin type.

3. Furthermore, a text file named `README.rst` must be provided where it is explained:

   * The plugin motivation, why and for what purpose was the plugin created.

   * How to use the plugin.

   * What does the plugin do and how it works.

   * The advantages and disadvantages of the plugin compared to the rest.

4. To register a plugin the user must choose a plugin ID between *BLOSC2_GLOBAL_REGISTERED_FILTERS_START* and *BLOSC2_GLOBAL_REGISTERED_FILTERS_STOP* and
   write it at `include/blosc2/codecs-registry.h`
   or `include/blosc2/filters-registry.h` depending on the plugin type. Then, you have to edit `include/blosc2/codecs-registry.c`or 
   
   `include/blosc2/filters-registry.c` in the next way:
  
   At the top it must be added `#include "plugin_folder/plugin_header.h"`, 
   
   and into the register function you must follow the same steps that were done for the existing plugins.   

5. Finally, the Blosc development team will carry out the evaluation process
   to decide whether the plugin is useful and hence, candidate to be integrated into the C-Blosc2
   source code distribution.  In case of a negative decision, the original author will be informed,
   together with a series of advices for starting a new iteration if desired.


Examples
--------

In the `plugins/` directory there can be found different examples of codecs and filters
available as plugins that can be used in the compression process, and that
can be used as an example on how to implement plugins that can make into C-Blosc2.
Some of these are `ndlz`, `ndcell`, `ndmean` or `bytedelta`.

We would like to express our gratitude to the NumFOCUS Foundation for providing the funds to implement this functionality.
